Hello Midstall community,

Over the last five years, building *ExpidusOS* has been an incredible learning journey-and while we're not closing that chapter, it’s time to adapt with intention.

---

## Why the Change?

As the sole contributor at Midstall, I’ve worn many hats. While my passion for open source-and for ExpidusOS-remains unwavering, evolving commitments in OSS and tooling have shown me: I simply don’t have the bandwidth to continue development solo.

---

## What Will Continue?

- **ExpidusOS isn’t gone.** All existing repositories will remain live and open.
- **There’s no shared roadmap just yet.** When the time is right, I hope to rally contributors or expand the team to revisit it.

---

## What Comes Next

Effective *open source ecosystems* take more than just code-they need strong tooling and rock-solid SDKs. To build toward that ecosystem sustainably, Midstall Software is pivoting to **specialized consulting** in:

- SDK design, documentation, and usability
- Cross-platform build systems and toolchains
- Reproducible environments using Nix and related tooling

This shift aligns with our core mission: enabling open, developer-friendly systems engineering.

---

## What This Means for You

- **For users and collaborators**: Thank you. Midstall remains committed to open source goodness.
- **For companies needing SDK help**: I’m now opening the door to consult on how your SDKs, toolchains, and dev workflows come together-cleanly, reliably, and open source-first.

Let’s continue building ecosystems that empower developers-together.

—Tristan
